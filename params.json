{"name":"CCM-Modding","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to CCM Modding.\r\nWe make Minecraft mods, all kinds of them. <br>\r\nOur official build server can be found [here](http://jenkins.dries007.net). <br>\r\nIf you want the maven repo, click [here](http://maven.dries007.net/content/repositories/ccm/). <br>\r\nWe can be found in #CCM on esper.net. <br>\r\n\r\n### Our mods\r\nMost of us have fun modding, this means that we don't have releases out 2 hours after a major MC update. \r\nWe try to keep stuff up to date, and finish projects every once in a while, but no promises. If a mod isn't updated within a month or if the repo is tagged as [Inactive], feel free to ask us for an update/progress report.<br>\r\nConfigurability is key with CCM, if you'd like something to be configurable and it isn't, we'll try to add an option somewhere. That said, always have a look at the .cfg file before you do, it might already exist.\r\n\r\n### You have a mod idea?\r\nFeel free to post suggestions on the relevant issue list on github. If you have a general suggestion, use the Nucleum-Omnium repo, that's our core.<br>\r\nIf you want a mod made, send us the idea and specs. We like working on suggestions, as they are often a lot of fun to play with.<br>\r\n\r\n### Issues and bugs\r\nWhen you report a bug, please have screenshots, logs and stacktraces. The more the better.<br>\r\nIf you can't provide us with stacktraces or logs, we can't help.\r\n\r\n### Developers and other contributors\r\n* @Dries007\r\n* @Claycorp\r\n* @CaptainShadows\r\n* @Morton00000\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
